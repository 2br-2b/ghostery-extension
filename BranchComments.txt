1. Two theme scss files palm-theme.scss and midnight-theme.scss are added under app\scss
2. Couple of lines in .\webpack.config.js ensure the themes are compiled as the rest of SCSS files. 
They end up in dist\css as palm_theme.css and midnight_theme.css. Will refer to them by file paths.
3. In src\classes\account.js getTheme function mimics the original, but returns file paths instead of
css stream.
4. In app\panel\utils\utils.js setTheme function is changed to add <link rel="stylesheet" href={path_to_theme}/>
element instead of inline <style> element.
